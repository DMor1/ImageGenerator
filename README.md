#ImageGenerator
This application is used to create a large number of test images with consecutively numbered file names (1.png, 2.png, 3.png, etc). In addition to generating the variable number of images, the actual picture will graphically contain the filename. As an example, image "100.png" will have a black background, with the text "100.png" drawn into the image.

This basic program is used to test applications which utilize many images and verify that the correct image is used. IE: If opening 35.png, can visually check that 35.png is in the image.

Below is an example of the program running. Entering the following will create 100 .jpg images from 1.jpg to 100.jpg. The images will be placed in the "Images" folder.
